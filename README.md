Building
--------

Use `jnetpcap-linux.jar` on Linux platforms and `jnetpcap.jar` on
Windows platforms.


Libraries
---------

No other additional files are needed to compile, provided that you
correctly reference all libraries in the lib directory.


Usage
-----

N order to run the program, you need two other directories
at the root level:

* `android-platforms/`: contains all android platforms from 7 to
  20. Android platforms can be copied from the android SDK.

* `apktool-framework/`: contains 1.apk, the framework needed for
  apktool. You can get it from the apktool project repository.
